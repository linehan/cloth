cloth is a toy web server designed to be as small as possible,
so that it can be read and understood in one sitting.

To use it, run

        ./cloth -p <PORT> -d <WWW_ROOT> &
        
('&' forks the process into the background in most shells)

To stop it, try 

        pkill cloth

If you don't have any content or just want to test it out, 
try providing the included www folder as a the WWW_ROOT path.

NOTE: the command line arguments must NOT be relative paths,
      i.e., no './foo' or '../bar'
